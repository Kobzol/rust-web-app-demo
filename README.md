# Rust web app demo
This is a very simple Rust web application built using Axum and many other crates, which served as a demonstrator
application for a live-demo that I presented at
the [Ostrava Techmeetup Rust meetup](https://www.meetup.com/techmeetupostrava/events/299912212/).
It was heavily inspired by the awesome [Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/) book by Luca Palmieri.
